I'm capturing my talks about statistics and performance monitoring given at Highload++ conference and other events (TODO: links) here for non-russian speakers. It's going to be a series of posts covering usage of some statistical methods that I've found useful for load testing (mostly tuning), production monitoring, system analysis.
