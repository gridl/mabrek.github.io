title:  "Exploring Performance Monitoring Data with Multivariate Tools: MDS and t-SNE"
---

This time I'm going to introduce tools that allow to explore data visually. They represent each time series as a point in 2-dimensional space. When original time series are similar the corresponding points will be close to each other.

The same data was used here as in previous post about [SVD and PCA]({{site.url}}/blog/multivariate-svd-pca/)


[Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_scaling) produces this kind of image given distance matrix calculated as `1 - abs(cor(a, b))` for each pair of time series:

It has put hill shaped series (1 - 5) together in the left corner of dot cloud which seems to be the most dense one. Different kinds of spikes landed on the upper corner (7 - 10). Series with strong increasing or decreasing trend landed on the right corner (13 -14) and step-like changes on the bottom.

This image was generated by Classical (Metric) Multidimensional Scaling using [cmdscale](http://www.inside-r.org/r-doc/stats/cmdscale) function from R.

    metric mds: cmdscale() is fast and produces usable results, doesn't care about duplicates
    non-metric mds: MASS:isoMDS gives identical results to cmdscale, complains about duplicates

The nice thing about non-metric MDS is that it can handle any type of time series (dis)similarity measures (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#Measures) not restricted to euclidean distance.

### t-SNE

[t-SNE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding)

tsne() is slow O(n^2) but results are usable too, it finds more groups in data
